### Project Lead

The Project Lead provides overall technical direction. The Lead is elected by Committers and serves until they step down or are replaced by a vote.

## Decision Making

### Consensus

Most decisions are made through lazy consensus:

1. A proposal is submitted (issue, PR, or discussion)
2. If no Committer objects within 72 hours, the proposal is accepted
3. Silence is consent

### Voting

For significant decisions (architecture changes, new Committers, governance changes):

- Each Committer has one vote
- Decisions require a simple majority (>50%) of voting Committers
- Voting period is 7 days
- Votes are cast publicly in the relevant GitHub issue or discussion

### Conflict Resolution

1. Discuss in the relevant issue or PR
2. If no consensus after 7 days, Committers vote
3. If tied, the Project Lead has the casting vote

## Becoming a Committer

Any Contributor can be nominated for Committer status by an existing Committer. The nomination is voted on by existing Committers. Criteria include:

- Sustained contributions over at least 3 months
- Quality of code and reviews
- Understanding of the DNS-AID architecture and IETF draft
- Adherence to the Code of Conduct
